# Deadlands Dice Roller

A simple textual roller of dice pools for a Deadlands Classic skill check.
A Deadlands Classic skill check involves 'exploding' dice ('aces' in Deadlands
terms) and the selection of only the single highest roll (or series of exploded
rolls) from a given pool, with critical failures ('busts') on a majority of 1s.

## Current Status

Ultra early pre alpha, heavily WIP. Not ready at all.

## Usage

Pass the argument '--halfbust' to switch bust mechanics to nonmajority 50% of
dice in the pool rolling a 1.

Type in the skill roll desired in the normal format of, eg, '3d8'

Type 'quit' to exit the program
